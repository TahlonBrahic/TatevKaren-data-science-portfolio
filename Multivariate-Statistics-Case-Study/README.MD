# Multivariate Statistics Case Study: US City Ranking

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/RStudio-Code__Run-blue?logo=RStudio)]()


**Why:** To identify the top US cities with highest capital, urban growth and development for purposes for everyone looking to relocate to or within US for various purposes.

**How:** Using Places Rated Almanac data to find the rankings of the cities in United States based on a single combination of 9 rating variables using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA). We also use Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to get more insights in this data and investigate the correlation between two sets of rating variables (if existing).

This Case Study in the field of Multivariate Statistics aims to find the rankings of the cities in United States based on a single combination of 9 rating variables using multivariate techniques: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA). Moreover, we will also use Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to get more insight of this data and investigate the correlation between two sets of rating variables (if existing). We aim to find the linear combination of rating variables that would maximally explain the variation of the data and rank the U.S. cities according to this new rating criterion.

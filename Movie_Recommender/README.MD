**Why:** For a given movie subscriber, determine the top N movies that this user will likely be interested in and if recommended he/she will watch these movies as well.

**How:** Using user's past rating data to train Item-Item Collaborative Filtering to predict top N movies the user is likely to assign a high rating.

 **Abstract**
 <br>
The increased popularity of e-commerce has led to an increase in both the number of onlineconsumers and products.  Deciding which product to buy from a large variety of productsmight be overwhelming.  Recommender systems (RS) are able to solve this problem of in-formation overload and help online buyers,  by suggesting them the right products to buy,resulting in higher customer satisfaction and customer loyalty.  Correspondingly, companiesget more opportunities to introduce new products and suggest them to the right customers,resulting in increased sales.  In order to make good recommendations, we must predict howa customer will respond to unseen product, based on the user feedback that often comes inthe form of a rating and review text.  However, traditional RS often use only the rating data,while ignoring the rich source of information present in usersâ€™ textual reviews and other typesof data.  Moreover, they are solely applicable to small datasets and unable to handle datasetswith millions of reviews.  

In this study, we designed a recommender system that combinesthe Latent Factor Model, based on rating data, with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation method,based on review data, applicable on both small and large data types.  We also investigatedthe  effect  of  adding  user-  and  item-  characteristics  on  the  performance  of  this  hybrid  rec-ommender  system.   Firstly,  we  found  that  adding  textual  reviews  to  the  RS  increases  itsprediction accuracy.  Secondly,  we observe that adding extra features to the recommendersystem increases the quality of its recommendations, which is especially true for medium andlarge datasets.

# Amazon Review Big Data
In this expeiment, we used collection of datasets provided corresponding to the 23 product categories supplied by **Amazon.com Review Data**. This data without duplicates was prepared by <a href = "https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/">Julian McAuley</a>. It consists of **142.8 million** product reviews and a metadata for 9.4 million products, spanning a period of 18 years, from May 1996 to July 2014

This figure visualizes the percentage of ratings and reviews per item. Brown (dark grey for black and white print) bars represent the percentage of items with less than 10 ratings per category. Green (light grey for black and white print) bars rep- resent the percentage of items having on average more than 30 words per product category.

# Python Code
To reproduce the results obtained in this analysis you can execute following Python coded step-by-step. Note that many of the libraries such as **Tensorflow** need to be preinstalled on your computer. You can use the following syntax in your command line to install the desired Python package:

```Python
# Check the versions of Pip3 and Python
python3 --version
pip3 --version

# Install necessary python packages.
sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev -y

# Upgrade pipo this is 
pip3 install --upgrade pip

# Install tensorflow (cpu only)
pip3 install tensorflow
```

# Advanced Marketing Models (FastMCD)

**Why:** Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is one of the most widely-used classification methods for predicting qualitative response variables but it is highly sensitive to the outliers and it produces unreliable results in case the data is contaminated. To improve the robustness of the LDA, itâ€™s necessary to consider robust estimators for means and covaraince matrices. The robustified LDA employs robust estimators for location and scatter to limit the impact of outliers in the data.

**How:** Using FastMCD algorithm to compute robust estimators for location and scatter parameters for robustified LDA where we code the FastMCD function/algorithm manually in R and verify it's results with a FastMCD function from R library.<br>

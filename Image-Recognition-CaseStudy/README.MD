# Case Study: Image Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks

**Why:** To identify the class which an image belongs a dog image class or a cat image class.

**How:** Using 8K images of dogs and cats to train Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to predict whether the input image is a dog image or a cat image.

# Image Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks

**Why:** To identify the class which an image belongs a dog image class or a cat image class.

**How:** Using 8K images of dogs and cats to train Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to predict whether the input image is a dog image or a cat image.


This is a Computer Vision Case Study with an Image recognition model that classifies an image to a binary class. Image recognition model based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify from an image whether it is dog or a cat image. In this case study we use 8000 images of dogs and cats to train and test a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that takes an image as an input and give as an output a class of 0 (cat) or 1 (dog) suggesting whether it is a dog or a cat picture. This image recognition model is based on CNN.

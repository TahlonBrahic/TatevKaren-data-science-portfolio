# Recurrent Neural Network Pricing Model

**Why:**  To determine the future value of a stock or a financial instrument traded (publicly) on an exchange to gain significant profit or avoid losses given efficient-market hypothesis. Although exact price prediction is nearly impossible, but approximate price estimation is possible and can positively impact investor's buying strategy.<br><br>
**How:** Using the past 5y historical stock price data and Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) with 5 LSTM layers combined with Time Series Analysis to predict the upward and downward trends in the future stock prices.<br>

## Case Study with 2 applications
In this case study we use Deep Learning, Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) layers to predict the price of the a financial instrument. We apply it in two different cases: 

- Google Stock Price Prediction
- Bitcoin Price Prediction

We combine Time Series Analysis with RNN model with LSTM layers to predict the price using the financial products' historical data of last 5 years (2016-2020). LSTM is more sophisticated version of RNN which addresses the Vanishing Gradient Problem that RNNs often suffer from.

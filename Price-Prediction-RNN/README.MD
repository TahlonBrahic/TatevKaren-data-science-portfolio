# Recurrent Neural Network Pricing Model

**Why:**  To determine the future value of a stock or a financial instrument traded (publicly) on an exchange to gain significant profit or avoid losses given efficient-market hypothesis. Although exact price prediction is nearly impossible, but approximate price estimation is possible and can positively impact investor's buying strategy.<br><br>
**How:** Using the past 5y historical stock price data and Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) with 5 LSTM layers combined with Time Series Analysis to predict the upward and downward trends in the future stock prices.<br>

# Customer Churn Rate Analysis with Artificial Neural Networks

**Why:** To estimate the churn rate of a bank customer in order to identify customers that are likely to leave the company and try to encourage them to stay by various marketing tools.

**How:** Using customer behavour data to train Artifical Neural Network (ANN) to predict the probability of each customer leaving the company.

## Case Study 
In this Business Case Study we predict the churn rate of bank customers. In order to learn about bank's customers we use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). From the millions of customers we have randomly selected 10K bank customers and we use their characteristics/features to train an ANN model to predict the probability of each customer leaving the bank.

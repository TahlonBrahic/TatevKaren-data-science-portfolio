# Customer Churn Rate Analysis with Artificial Neural Networks

**Why:** To estimate the churn rate of a bank customer in order to identify customers that are likely to leave the company and try to encourage them to stay by various marketing tools.

**How:** Using customer behavour data to train Artifical Neural Network (ANN) to predict the probability of each customer leaving the company.
